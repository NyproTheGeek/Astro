# The Dexter Book {#the-swift-book}

Welcome to The Dexter Book. This book introduces the Dexter Programming Language.

## Who is this book for? {#who-is-this-book-for}

This book is for those who want to learn how to write programs in Dexter. 

The goal of this book is to write the most up to date content for Dexter. You need a certain level of understanding of how a computer works.

We will be referring to terms such as RAM, or memory. Should a term be unclear, we will provide a definition of it. We will provide a link where you can read more about that term if the definition is not provided in the book itself.
