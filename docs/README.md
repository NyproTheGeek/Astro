### Introduction
Dexter is a statically-typed multi-paradigm programming language with an actor-based concurrency model. Dexter uniqueness comes from combining [multiple dispatch][1], [uniform function call syntax][2] (UFCS) and [structural typing][3]. These concepts give Dexter a [dynamic language][4] feel along with the benefits of a [static language][5].
