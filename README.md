# Quadro Programming Lanaguage
DESCRIPTION
Quadro is a statically-typed multi-paradigm language. 
Quadro relies on multiple dispatch and UFCS to make OOP intuitive. 
Quadro is heavily influenced by Python, Scala, Swift and Julia.

Quadro looks dynamic but moves statically.

I'm currently taking questions about the language [here](http://www.nairaland.com/3557200/astro-programming-language-0.2-made).
