# Astro Programming Lanaguage
DESCRIPTION
Astro is a statically-typed multi-paradigm language. 
Astro relies on multiple dispatch and UFCS to make OOP intuitive. 
Astro is heavily influenced by Python, Scala, Swift and Julia.

Astro looks dynamic, but moves statically.

We are currently answering questions about the language [here](http://www.nairaland.com/3557200/astro-programming-language-0.2-made).
