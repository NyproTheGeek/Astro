# Dexter Programming Language
DESCRIPTION
Dexter is a statically-typed multi-paradigm language. 
Dexter relies on multiple dispatch and UFCS to make OOP intuitive. 
Dexter is heavily influenced by Python, Scala, Swift and Julia.

Dexter looks dynamic but moves statically.

I'm currently taking questions about the language [here](http://www.nairaland.com/3557200/astro-programming-language-0.2-made).
